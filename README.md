In this project, PCA, LDA and LPP are successfully implemented in Java for face recognition. After the system is trained by the training data, the feature space “eigenfaces” through PCA, the feature space “fisherfaces” through LDA and the feature space “laplacianfaces” through LPP are found using respective methods. This system inplements  three different distance classifier: CosineDissimilarity, L1Distance and EuclideanDistance. Also implemented: KNN.

This project is based on two databases of faces: ORL and Yale

ORL Database of Faces, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html)
Yale Database of Faces, [http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database)
